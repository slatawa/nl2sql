3  SAP Non-Prod          Monitoring Analytics Report      0.605901"," The major products driving cost increase in SAP Non-Prod are:

- Microsoft Azure Infrastructure: This product accounts for the highest cost, at $20,259.93. This could be due to increased usage of Azure resources, such as compute, storage, or networking.

- RHEL 7.6 for SAP Virtual Machine v2: This product comes in second, with a cost of $6,644.58. This could be due to an increase in the number of virtual machines running RHEL or higher utilization of existing VMs.

These two products together account for over 95% of the total cost in SAP Non-Prod. Monitoring Analytics Report has a negligible contribution to the total cost.

It is recommended to investigate the usage patterns and optimization opportunities for Microsoft Azure Infrastructure and RHEL 7.6 for SAP Virtual Machine v2 to identify potential cost-saving measures."

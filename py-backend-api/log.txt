Question: Which counties have the highest and lowest ratios of providers to enrolled participants in Medi-Cal?                         

Prompt:
Only use the following tables meta-data:

```

Table Name : medi-cal-and-calfresh-enrollment

Description: This table provides information about the enrollment of individuals in Medi-Cal and CalFresh programs in different counties. This information in this table can be used to calculate the ratio of beneficiaries and service providers for a particular program

Question: What county has the greatest enrollment in WIC per capita?                         

Prompt:
Only use the following tables meta-data:

```

Table Name : wic-redemption-by-county-by-participant-category-data-2010-2018

Description: This table provides information about the enrolment data per capita, WIC vouchers by county, participant category, and year/month. It includes the number of participants who redeemed vouchers, the number of vouchers redeemed, the total cost of vouchers, the average cost per voucher, the statewide infant formula rebate, the total cost of vouchers after adjusting for the rebate, the average cost per voucher after adjusting for the rebate, and the state average cost per voucher after adjusting for the rebate

This table has the following columns : 
Vendor_Location                     (STRING) : Refers to County or region. 
Participant_Category                     (STRING) : Refers to the type of beneficiaries. It contains values : "ALL", "Child  ", "Infant  ", "Prenatal  ", "Breastfeeding Mother  ", "Non-Breastfeeding Mother  ".
Year_Month                     (STRING) : Year in which the vouchers are redeemed. 
_Number_of_Participants_Redeemed_                     (STRING) : Total number of beneficiaries who have redeemed the vouchers. 
_Number_Vouchers_Redeemed_                     (STRING) : Number of vouchers redeemed by all the beneficiaries. 
Total_Cost_Vouchers                     (STRING) : Total cost of the vouchers redeemed by the beneficiaries. 
Average_Cost                     (FLOAT) : Average cost of the vouchers.

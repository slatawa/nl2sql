For this question what would be the most accurate SQL query?
Question: Which county has the greatest proportion of CalFresh recipients co-enrolled in at least one additional program? 

Sql_query: 
SELECT Number AS county, 
       COALESCE(SUM(CAST(Person AS INT64)), 0) AS total_calfresh_recipients,

For this question what would be the most accurate SQL query?
Question: What county has the greatest enrollment in WIC per capita? 

Sql_query: There are two possible ways to interpret this question.

**Interpretation 1**: Calculate the total WIC enrollment per county and divide it by the county's population to determine the enrollment per capita.


WITH CountyPopulation AS (
  SELECT
    COUNTY,
    CAST(POP2020 AS INT64) AS Population

FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.`WICEnrollment`
JOIN
  CountyPopulation ON WICEnrollment.Vendor_Location = CountyPopulation.COUNTY
ORDER BY
  EnrollmentPerCapita DESC
LIMIT 1;


**Interpretation 2**: Calculate the total WIC enrollment for each participant category and divide it by the county's population to determine the enrollment per capita for each category.


WITH CountyPopulation AS (
  SELECT
    COUNTY,
    CAST(POP2020 AS INT64) AS Population

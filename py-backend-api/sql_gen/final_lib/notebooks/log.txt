For this question what would be the most accurate SQL query?
Question: Which county has the greatest proportion of CalFresh recipients co-enrolled in at least one additional program? 

Sql_query: 
SELECT Number AS county, 
       COALESCE(SUM(CAST(Person AS INT64)), 0) AS total_calfresh_recipients,

For this question what would be the most accurate SQL query?
Question: What county has the greatest enrollment in WIC per capita? 

Sql_query: There are two possible ways to interpret this question.

**Interpretation 1**: Calculate the total WIC enrollment per county and divide it by the county's population to determine the enrollment per capita.


WITH CountyPopulation AS (
  SELECT
    COUNTY,
    CAST(POP2020 AS INT64) AS Population

FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.`WICEnrollment`
JOIN
  CountyPopulation ON WICEnrollment.Vendor_Location = CountyPopulation.COUNTY
ORDER BY
  EnrollmentPerCapita DESC
LIMIT 1;


**Interpretation 2**: Calculate the total WIC enrollment for each participant category and divide it by the county's population to determine the enrollment per capita for each category.


WITH CountyPopulation AS (
  SELECT
    COUNTY,
    CAST(POP2020 AS INT64) AS Population

Question: What is the breakdown by program
SQL : SELECT  Program, COALESCE(SUM(SAFE_CAST(  Hispanic  AS INT64)), 0) AS total_hispanic FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs-dashboard-2015-2020-annual-data-file`  group by Program order by Program; 

Question: How many of them live in Nevada County?
SQL : SELECT SUM(CAST(Person AS INT64)) AS total_beneficiaries FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs-dashboard-2015-2020-annual-data-file` where Level='County' and Number='Nevada' and Program = 'Medi-Cal'; 

Question: Which counties have the highest and lowest ratios of providers to enrolled participants in CalFresh?
SQL : select annual_file.Number, (count(provider.OBJECTID )/ sum(SAFE_CAST(annual_file.person AS INT64)))  *100 as ratio FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs-dashboard-2015-2020-annual-data-file`  AS annual_file  join `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs_medi-cal_managed_care_provider_listing` as provider on annual_file.Number = provider.County where annual_file.level = 'County' and provider.RecordType = 'Provider' group by annual_file.Number order by 2 limit 5 


    

For this question what would be the most accurate BigQuery SQL query?

**Instructions:**
* Generate syntactically correct BigQuery SQL for the following question.
* Use only relevant columns from the schema. DO NOT use columns not mentioned in this meta-data.
* Use only relevant table name as provided and do not qualify tablename with backticks(`).
* Validate column names against the schema to avoid errors.
* Use a maximum of 10 columns.
* Prioritize keywords that indicate calculations.
* Use the following examples as guidelines to generate the new BigQuery SQL accordingly

Question: What is the breakdown by program
SQL : SELECT  Program, COALESCE(SUM(SAFE_CAST(  Hispanic  AS INT64)), 0) AS total_hispanic FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs-dashboard-2015-2020-annual-data-file`  group by Program order by Program; 

Question: How many of them live in Nevada County?
SQL : SELECT SUM(CAST(Person AS INT64)) AS total_beneficiaries FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs-dashboard-2015-2020-annual-data-file` where Level='County' and Number='Nevada' and Program = 'Medi-Cal'; 

Question: Which counties have the highest and lowest ratios of providers to enrolled participants in CalFresh?
SQL : select annual_file.Number, (count(provider.OBJECTID )/ sum(SAFE_CAST(annual_file.person AS INT64)))  *100 as ratio FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs-dashboard-2015-2020-annual-data-file`  AS annual_file  join `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs_medi-cal_managed_care_provider_listing` as provider on annual_file.Number = provider.County where annual_file.level = 'County' and provider.RecordType = 'Provider' group by annual_file.Number order by 2 limit 5 


    

For this question what would be the most accurate BigQuery SQL query?
Question: What about the ratio to licensed facilities? 

Sql_query: 
SELECT
  annual_file.Number,
  (
    COUNT(DISTINCT provider.License_Number) /
    SUM(CAST(annual_file.Person AS INT64))
  ) * 100 AS ratio_to_licensed_facilities
FROM `cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs-dashboard-2015-2020-annual-data-file` AS annual_file
JOIN
  cdii-poc.HHS_Program_Counts.calhhs_medi-cal_managed_care_provider_listing AS provider
ON
  annual_file.Number = provider.County
WHERE
  annual_file.Level = 'County'
  AND provider.RecordType = 'Provider'
GROUP BY
  annual_file.Number
ORDER BY
  ratio_to_licensed_facilities DESC
LIMIT 5;
